Beginning:
Once upon a time there was a man named John. John was planning on 
going to Britain over the summer until when COVID suddenly hit. 
Because of this, he was quite unhappy for a month. Then, an idea hit him:
he would take a road trip through the United States!

Middle:
So he started planning. He would visit three states that he had always wanted to see: Minnesota, North Dakota, and California. 
He loaded his bags and set out in his 1997 Saturn SL.

End:
He started off in California, where he was promply fined for $100,000 for breaking COVID rules. He left the next day towards North Dakota, feeling very sad. John spent three months in North Dakota just fooling around and camping at State and National parks. When he arrived in Minnesota, he first stopped in Minneapolis. There, he set the Gopher stadium on fire because Minnesota sucks, and Wisconsin is superior.
