Beginning:
Once upon a time there was a man named John. John was planning on 
going to Britain over the summer until when COVID suddenly hit. 
Because of this, he was quite unhappy for a month. Then, an idea hit him:
he would take a road trip through the United States!

Middle:
So he started planning. He would visit three states that he had always wanted to see: Minnesota, North Dakota, and California. 
He loaded his bags and set out in his 1997 Saturn SL.

End:
